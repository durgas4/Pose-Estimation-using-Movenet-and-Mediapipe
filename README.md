## Features

- **Pose Estimation**: Utilizes Movenet and Mediapipe for accurate pose detection.
- **Classification**: Implements a multilayer perceptron for pose classification.
- **Dataset**: Includes a dataset of Indian sculptures for training and testing.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/durgas4/Pose-Estimation-using-Movenet-and-Mediapipe.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Pose-Estimation-using-Movenet-and-Mediapipe
   ```

3. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the pose estimation model, execute the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

Make sure to have your dataset ready and properly configured in the script.

## Dataset

The project includes a dataset of images of Indian sculptures. The dataset is structured as follows:

- **Dataset1**: Contains images for training.
- **Dataset2**: Contains images for testing.
- **Annotations**: An Excel file (`annotate.xlsx`) for pose annotations.

## License

This project is licensed under the MIT License. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for more details.

## Future Work

- **Optimization**: Further optimization of the model specifically for Indian sculptures.
- **Enhancements**: Explore additional features and improvements in pose classification accuracy.
